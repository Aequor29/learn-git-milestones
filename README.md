### Installation
Install your development environment

- [ ] On the command line, confirm Git is installed by typing `git` at the prompt and hitting enter
- [ ] [Install Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [ ] Connect your Github account in Githhub Desktop

  - [ ] In Atom, create a new file in Atom called `hello.txt`, add some text, and save it.
    - [ ] Click the small Git button at the bottom right to display the Git panel. 
    - [ ] Click on your file in Unstaged changes and confirm your changes match what you see in Github Desktop.
